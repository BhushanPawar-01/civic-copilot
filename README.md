# Civic Copilot

**Civic Copilot** is an AI-powered assistant designed to streamline civic processes, automate information retrieval, and enhance user interactions with government or civic data. The project features a modular backend, a user-friendly frontend, and robust support for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), large language models (LLMs), and session management.

## Features

- **Modular AI Agents**: Intent, action, policy, and verification agents for flexible task orchestration.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Integrates FAISS-based document retrieval for context-aware responses.
- **Multi-LLM Support**: Hugging Face Inference API implemented. OpenAI and Gemini support are planned (not yet available).
- **Session Management**: Persistent memory and summarization for user sessions.
- **Audit Logging**: Traceable logs for transparency and debugging.
- **Streamlit Frontend**: Simple, interactive UI for end users.

## System Architecture

Civic Copilot follows a **layered, explicit architecture** with a clear separation between UI, orchestration, intelligence, and storage.

> The system is intentionally **orchestrated, not autonomous** — every decision path is predictable, debuggable, and auditable.

### Detailed Request Lifecycle
![Civic Copilot Architecture](img/flowchart-civic-copilot.png)
*Diagram location: `img/flowchart-civic-copilot.png`*

## Architecture Components (Deep Dive)

### 1. Streamlit Frontend

The Streamlit UI acts as the **interaction layer**:

* Accepts user queries
* Allows LLM provider selection
* Displays:

  * Final response
  * Source citations
  * Confidence indicators
  * Optional reasoning trace (collapsed by default)

---

### 2. API Gateway (FastAPI Backend)

FastAPI serves as the system’s **entry point and traffic controller**:

* Validates requests
* Manages sessions
* Routes execution to the orchestrator
* Returns structured responses to the frontend

---

### 3. Session & Memory Manager

Instead of replaying raw chat history, Civic Copilot uses **summarization-based memory**.

After each interaction:

* Key facts are summarized
* User intent and unresolved issues are stored
* Previous decisions are persisted in structured form

This prevents context explosion and mirrors **real production conversational systems**.

---

### 4. Agent Orchestrator

The orchestrator is the **control plane** of the system.

It:

* Receives structured context from memory
* Determines agent execution order
* Enforces schema-based communication
* Prevents agents from bypassing responsibility boundaries

This explicit orchestration favors **predictability over novelty**.

---

### 5. Agents

Each agent has **one responsibility** and communicates through typed schemas.

#### Intent Agent

* Interprets user intent and domain
* Outputs confidence-scored structured intent
* Triggers clarification if confidence is low

#### Policy / Knowledge Agent (RAG)

* Retrieves official rules, timelines, and documents
* Grounds responses using citations
* Never generates unsupported claims

#### Action Agent

* Converts policy facts into actionable steps
* Suggests escalation paths and next actions
* Optimized for practical outcomes

#### Verification Agent

* Checks for hallucinations or weak grounding
* Flags uncertainty
* Adds disclaimers where required

### 6. LLM Provider Abstraction

All agents rely on a common `LLMClient` interface.

**Supported provider:**
- Hugging Face Inference API (implemented)

**Planned providers:**
- OpenAI API (future)
- Gemini API (future)

This prevents vendor lock-in and allows experimentation without agent rewrites.

---

### 7. RAG Layer

The RAG layer ensures **truth grounding**:

* FAISS vector store
* Indexed government portals, PDFs, and circulars
* Returns chunks with metadata and sources

The layer is **read-only and auditable**.

---

### 8. Audit & Trace Layer

Every request generates an internal trace:

* Invoked agents
* Data sources used
* Uncertainty points

This trace can be:

* Partially exposed to users
* Fully logged for debugging and evaluation

## Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- pip

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**
	```sh
	git clone https://github.com/your-org/civic-copilot.git
	cd civic-copilot
	```
2. **Install dependencies:**
	```sh
	pip install -r requirements.txt
	```
3. **Prepare data (optional):**
	- Place raw documents in `data/raw/`.
	- Use `setup_data.py` to process and index documents.
	```sh
	python setup_data.py
	```
4. **Run the backend server:**
	```sh
	cd backend
	uvicorn main:app --reload
	```
5. **Launch the frontend:**
	```sh
	cd frontend
	streamlit run streamlit_app.py
	```

## Usage

1. Open the Streamlit app in your browser (default: http://localhost:8501).
2. Interact with the assistant to ask questions or perform civic tasks.
3. Backend logs and audit trails are available in the `backend/logs/` directory.
