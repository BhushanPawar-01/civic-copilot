        "text": "COMPENDIUM OF INSTRUCTIONS/ GUIDELINES RELATING TO ISSUE OF PASSPORTS IN INDIA/ABROAD (Updated upto 31st May, 2020) Disclaimer : This compendium consists of guidelines for Passport Issuing Authorities framed under the Passports Act, 1967 and rules made thereunder, and are not exhaustive in nature. The decision of the competent authority will be final. CHAPTER - 1 EVOLUTION OF PASSPORTS IN INDIA 1. DEFENCE OF INDIA ACT, 1915 1.1. There was no practice of issuing Indian passports before the First World War. During the war, the Government of India enacted the Defence of India Act in 1915 and promulgated rules thereunder, which mandated possession of a passport compulsory for exit from and entry into India. 1.2. The Act expired six months after the end of the war. It was, however, desired that the Government of India should retain power to continue that system in whole or in part for purpose of bringing the Indian practice in line with that of other dominions of the British Empire and of other countries. 2. THE INDIAN PASSPORT ACT, 1920 2.1. The Government of India, therefore, enacted the Indian Passport Act, 1920 which substantially retained the provisions of the Defence of India Act. The 1920 Act was renamed as \u201cThe Passport (Entry into India) Act, 1920\", after the enactment of the Passports Act, 1967, and is still in operation requiring mandatory possession of passports by persons entering India. This 1920 Act is administered by the Ministry of Home Affairs. 2.2. Though \u2018Emigration\u2019 continued as a Central subject even after the Government of India Act, 1935 was passed, the Central Government delegated to the State Governments the power to issue passports on its behalf. Accordingly, some of the then State Governments, viz., Bombay, Central Province of Berar, Delhi, United Provinces, etc., opened regular passport offices under their Home Departments. 3. PASSPORT REGULATIONS AFTER INDEPENDENCE 3.1. The issue of passports became a Central subject under the Indian Constitution and was allotted to the Ministry of External Affairs under the Transaction of Business Rules. Until 1954, this work was continued to be carried out by the respective State Governments on behalf of this Ministry. It was in 1954 that the first five Regional Passport Offices at Mumbai, Kolkata, Delhi, Chennai 1. Defence of India Act, 1915 2. The Indian Passport Act, 1920 3.

Passport Seva Project (PSP) and Nagpur were set up. This necessitated the setting up of a separate organization and the Central Passport and Emigration Organization was created in 1959 as a Subordinate Office of the Ministry of External Affairs. With the enactment of the Emigration Act, 1983, the work relating to \u2018emigration\u2019 was separated and transferred to the Ministry of Labour. The Emigration Act was subsequently being administered by the Ministry of Overseas Indian Affairs which was merged with the Ministry of External Affairs in January 2016. 4.

The Emigration Act was subsequently being administered by the Ministry of Overseas Indian Affairs which was merged with the Ministry of External Affairs in January 2016. 4. ENACTMENT OF THE PASSPORTS ACT, 1967 4.1. The power to issue passports was earlier being exercised by the Government by virtue of Article 73 read with List I, Item 19 of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India. 4.2. In the case of Satwant Singh Sawhney vs. Government of India in 1966, the Supreme Court held that there should be an Act to govern the issue of passports to avoid the element of arbitrariness in passport matters. The Government, therefore, promulgated the Passports Ordinance, 1967 and later replaced it with the present Passports Act, 1967 (15 of 1967), which came into force on 24th June, 1967(Appendix-2). This day is now being celebrated by the Ministry as the \u201cPassport Seva Divas\u201d every year when meetings with all Passports Officers are held, performance reviewed and awards given by the External Affairs Minister to top performers. 4.3. The Passports Act was subsequently amended in 1978, 1993 and 2001. Under the Passports Act, 1967, the Central Government has the powers to frame rules. The first such rules called the Passports Rules, 1967 were thus framed the same year. Some of these rules were amended, supplemented and repealed from time to time. The amendments were consolidated and the rules were last issued as the Passports Rules 1980 that have also been amended since then. The Passport application form and the information booklet attached therewith are also part of these rules. 5. ORIGIN OF THE PASSPORT MANUAL 5.1. Till 1966, the issue of passports was regulated through administrative instructions. These instructions were initially codified in the Passport Manual 1949, which was further consolidated in 1959, 1983 and 2001, incorporating instructions issued from time to time. In the initial years, the philosophy regarding issue of passport was that this was considered to be a discretionary matter for the Central Government. This authority was, however, to be discharged without discrimination. The passports were, therefore, issued after the relevant authorities were assured that the security of the State and its good name would be maintained by the passport holders. 6. CENTRAL PASSPORT ORGANISATION (CPO) 6.1. The Central Passport Organisation is a subordinate organisation under the Ministry of External Affairs which renders all passport services in India. The CPO has a sanctioned strength of 2,741 officers and staff as on 31st December, 2019 and is headed by Joint Secretary (Passport Seva Programme) & Chief Passport Officer, who is also the Appellate Authority under the Passports Act and the Head of Department under the Delegation of Financial Powers Rules (DFPR) 1978. 7.

To augment and improve the delivery of passport services to Indian citizens and to render passport services in a time bound, transparent, modern and comfortable atmosphere, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), launched the Passport Seva Prgramme (PSP) in May 2010 in Public-Private Partnership (PPP) mode with M/s Tata Consultancy Services as the Service Provider which was selected through an open competitive bidding process. It is an ambitious e- governance initiative and is part of the National e-Governance Plan. The PSP has enabled simple, efficient and transparent processes for delivery of passport and related services. Under this program, the sovereign and fiduciary functions like verification, granting and issuing of passports have been retained by MEA. The ownership and strategic control of core assets including data/information are also with MEA. A new set of rules titled \u201cThe Passports Application (Facilitation and Processing) Rules, 2010\u201d has been notified to cover the Passport Seva Project structure. 7.2. MEA in association with the Department of Posts (DoP) announced an innovative initiative on 24 January, 2017 to open PSK at the Head Post Offices (HPO)/ Post Offices (PO) in the country called \u2018Post Office Passport Seva Kendra\u2019 (POPSK). The POPSK are functioning like the other existing PSK. 7.3. As on 30 April, 2020, there were 36 Passport Offices and 93 Passport Seva Kendras (PSK) and 424 Post Office Passport Seva Kendras (POPSK) are functioning as extended arms of these Passport Offices in the country. 7.4. The process of integrating the Indian Embassies and Consulates abroad into the PSP commenced in October 2018 and is continuing today. The aim is to provide a centralized passport issuance platform and application for the Indian citizens living abroad and seeking Passport-related services. The Ministry has successfully integrated the passport issuance systems in 59 Missions and Posts till 30 April, 2020. ******** CHAPTER - 2 PASSPORTS AND TRAVEL DOCUMENTS \u2013 ESSENTIALITY, DEFINITION AND CLASSES 1. POSSESSION OF A PASSPORT OR TRAVEL DOCUMENT: ESSENTIALITY All persons who depart or intend to depart from India are required to be in possession of a valid passport or travel document. The word 'person\u2019 includes Indian citizens. The necessity of a travel document or a passport has arisen from International Convention and usage among nations. The term \u2018passport\u2019 or \u2018travel document\u2019 includes Indian documents issued under Passports Act, 1967 and Rules made thereunder. The word \u2018departure\u2019 with grammatical variations and cognate expressions, means departure from India by water, land or air. 2. EXEMPTIONS TO POSSESSION OF A PASSPORT OR TRAVEL DOCUMENT 2.1. The Central Government had been entrusted with the power under Section 21 of the Passports Ordinance, 1967 to grant exemptions from possession of these documents. Such authority now vests with the Central Government u/s 22 of the Passports Act. From time to time, the Central Government has exercised its authority under these clauses.

At present, this exemption is made in respect of certain named \u2018countries\u2019 and certain categories of persons, which are as under:- a) Indian and Nepalese citizens for their departure from India to Nepal [GSR 715 and 716, dated 15/05/1967]. Exception: Effective from July 2000, both Indians and Nepalese travelling by air between India and Nepal are required to possess passport; b) Indian and Bhutanese citizens for their departure from India to Bhutan [GSR 719 and 720 dated 15/05/1967]; c) Indian armed forces personnel departing from India on official duty on Government transport and also members of their families accompanying them in such transport [GSR 1319 dated 30/08/1967]; and, 1.

Vide GSR195(E) dated 17th March 2015, possession of valid Indian passports has been made mandatory for Indian citizens who are members of the crew and tindals of sailing vessels for travelling abroad, with effect from 1st June 2015. Government of India has since withdrawn the earlier exemption granted, vide GSR 1812 dated 25th September 1968, to the Indian members of the crew and tindals of sailing vessels to travel abroad on the basis of their identity cards, Continuous Discharge Certificates (CDCs) etc., instead of passports. 3. CLASSES OF PASSPORTS 3.1. The following classes of passports may be issued under the Passports Act, namely:- a) Ordinary Passports, b) Diplomatic Passports, and c) Official Passports. 3.2. The Central Government has prescribed classes of persons to whom the above passports may be issued. These would be discussed in subsequent chapters. 4. CLASSES OF TRAVEL DOCUMENTS 4.1. Under the Passports Act, the Central Government may issue the following classes of travel documents: a) Emergency Certificate, authorizing a person to enter India; b) Certificate of Identity for the purpose of establishing the identity of a person; and c) Certificate or documents, as may be prescribed. 5. PASSPORTS FOR A NAMED COUNTRY 5.1. The Passports (Amendment) Act, 1978 has incorporated a provision for issue of passports for a \u2018named country\u2019.

The Passports (Amendment) Act, 1978 has incorporated a provision for issue of passports for a \u2018named country\u2019. Such passports were earlier issued for travel between India and Bangladesh, India and Sri Lanka and vice versa. These special passports are no longer being issued. 6. ISSUE OF PASSPORTS TO NON-NATIONALS 6.1. A passport is largely an identity and travel document issued to the State's own nationals. Many countries issue passport to foreigners in the absence of any travel documents but specify their respective foreign citizenship in the passport. The British Overseas Passport is a well known example. Thus, a passport provides evidence of the holder's nationality, but this is placed in the same category as any other evidence of the citizenship status of an individual. Under Section 20 of the Passports Act, 1967, Indian passports/travel documents may be issued to non- nationals. This power, however, vests with the Central Government only. This authority of the Central Government can be exercised by the Secretary/ Additional Secretary/ Joint Secretary/ Director/ Deputy Secretary, in charge of the Passport Division in the Ministry of External Affairs. Such an authority cannot be exercised by any other Passport Authority and all such cases of issue of passports to non- Indian citizens require the prior approval of the Central Government, unless such powers have been delegated by the Central Government. At present, such powers have been delegated to Indian Missions in Yangon and Bangkok and the Passport Officer, Ahmedabad, for certain categories of persons, under specific conditions, which are discussed in detail in the succeeding paragraphs. 7. DELEGATION OF POWERS U/S 20 OF THE PASSPORTS ACT, 1967 7.1. Embassy of India, Bangkok, has been empowered to issue passports to persons of Indian origin residing in Thailand, whose national status has not been verified, describing their national status, inter alia, as \u2018Indian\u2019 or \u2018Indian by birth\u2018 or \u2018person of Indian origin\u2019 [GSR 254 dated 22/02/1971]. 7.2. The Embassy of India, Yangon, has been authorized to exercise powers u/s 20 of the Passports Act to grant passports to persons of Indian origin residing in Myanmar (formerly Union of Burma) and holding Foreigners Registration Certificate issued by Government of the Union of Myanmar. The passports in such cases are to be granted for a period of one year at a time and endorsed for Myanmar only [GSR 353(E) dated 26/5/1976 for six months and further extended to one year in May 2016]. 7.3 Passport Officer, Ahmedabad, has also been delegated authority to grant Certificate of Identity to persons of Indian origin who came back to India from Kenya and Uganda, and are residing within the State of Gujarat and the Union Territory of Dadra and Nagar Haveli [GSR 420(E) dated 29/06/1977]. ******* 3.

The provisions of this Chapter apply primarily to the cases of re-issue of passports and not in the case of fresh issue of passports, that is, only to those persons who have already held or hold an Indian passport. 2. POWERS TO RECTIFY ERRORS U/S 21 OF GENERAL CLAUSES ACT 2.1. All authorities, including Passport Authority, have the power to rectify clerical errors in accordance with Section 21 of the General Clauses Act, 1897. Therefore, purely clerical errors in passport, including error in DOB, can be corrected by the Passport Authority. Any rectification of entries in a passport would be done only by re-issue of passport and not by any kind of endorsement in a passport. 3. CHANGE OF NAME 3.1. Ministry, vide Notification GSR No. 1171 (E), dated 26.12.2016, framed rules, including the procedure to be followed and the documents to be submitted for re-issue of passport with the changed name of the applicant. These are given below: 3.1.1. Following marriage, remarriage or divorce, except details provided by the applicant in the application, no proof of marriage/dissolution of marriage or any court orders/decree would be required in the following cases: (a) An applicant applying for re-issue of passport for incorporation of the name of his/her spouse; (b) A woman applying for change of name/surname in existing passport due to marriage; (c) Divorcees applying for change of name or for deletion of spouse\u2019s name in existing passport; (d) Re-married applicants applying for change of name/spouse\u2019s name in passport. 3.1.2. In other circumstances for change of name, the applicant (both male and female) should furnish: (i) clippings of two local newspapers or the Gazette notification of the concerned State Government, as the case may be; (ii) at least two public/school documents issued in the desired name to ascertain that the applicant has actually changed his name. (iii) In case of NRI applicants and their dependent family members who have been staying abroad on long term permanent or work visa/permit, two public documents issued by the local government/local school/educational institution where the student is enrolled may be accepted. This would not be applicable for temporary residents and visitors from India or third countries. 3.1.3. Regarding the endorsement of spouse name of same sex, the matter was considered in detail in consultation with the L&T Division of the Ministry and the Department of Legal Affairs, Ministry of Law & Justice. There is no provision in the marriage laws to regulate the marriage of same sex people in India.",

There is no provision in the marriage laws to regulate the marriage of same sex people in India. Endorsement of spouse name of same sex in the passport of an applicant is not advisable. 3.1.4. The following cases are to be considered as name change and the provisions of Para 3.1.2. are to be applied in these cases: (a) Married woman wishing to revert to maiden name when not divorced or widowed; (b) Change of name upon attaining adulthood from childhood; (c) Minor change in name; and (d) Change/addition of surname. 3.2. Minor correction in name 3.2.1. The following cases are not to be considered as name change and the provisions of Para 3.1. are not to be applied in these cases: (i) Spelling correction/change of spelling which phonetically does not result in change in name (e.g., D\u2019souza to De Souza); (ii) Variation of a name as mentioned in Birth Certificate (e.g., Sanjiv to Sanjeev) (iii) Shifting of words/changing arrangements of various parts of existing name without inserting/ deleting any words /letters in the existing name (e.g., Parmeshwaran Shiva Kumaran to Shiva Parmeshwaran Kumaran). The most recent name as shown in at least a couple of personal documents, educational certificates etc. issued by Government authorities are to be submitted in such cases. However, shifting parts of name should not be allowed where the initial name/abbreviation is father\u2019s name as is the practice in Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Telengana or where the last name is the father\u2019s name as is the practice in Maharashtra. In such cases, procedure stipulated at para 3.2 should be followed. (iv) Splitting of given name into first name and surname may be allowed subject to production of at least two public documents in the said name. In most countries, there is a requirement to mention surname, which is not the case in India. Applicants may be allowed to split the existing parts of the name into first name and surname, without any change or addition/deletion of any part of the name. Example, if an applicant held a passport showing DILIP KUMAR as the given name and surname is blank, he may be allowed to enter DILIP as first name and KUMAR as surname. If an applicant held a passport in the name of SANJU MOHAN PRASAD with surname field blank, he may be allowed to enter SANJU MOHAN or SANJU as the first name and PRASAD or MOHAN PRASAD as surname. It has to be borne in mind that there is no separation in name into first/ given name and surname in most of the IDs/Documents issued in India. 3.3.

The Supreme Court in its judgement dated 9/7/1991 in Y. Narasimha Rao and Ors vs. Y. Venkata Lakshmi and Anr. held that the decree dissolving the marriage passed by the foreign court is without jurisdiction according to the Hindu Marriage Act as neither the marriage was celebrated nor the parties last resided together nor the respondent resided within the jurisdiction of that Court. Further, irretrievable breakdown of marriage is not one of the grounds recognized by the Act of dissolution of marriage. The Supreme Court's order is broadly based on Section 13 of the Civil Procedure Code of India. Hence, PIAs may refuse to accept any ex-parte foreign divorce judgement even if it\u2019s duly apostilled/ authenticated by foreign Government or Indian Mission/ Post abroad for purpose of grant of any passport service. 3.3.2. In case of mutually agreed or mutually properly contested divorce cases also, an application must be submitted by the parties at the competent Indian civil court and a declaratory order authenticating and confirming that the foreign divorce decree is in accordance with Indian law must be obtained by the concerned parties, before the mutual/contested foreign divorce is accepted by PIAs for grant of any passport service. 3.4. ADOPTED CHILDREN (change in name and change of parents\u2019 name) 3.4.1. WHEN AN ADOPTED CHILD ALREADY POSSESSES A PASSPORT: (i) Inter-country adoption: In the case of an adopted child who already possesses a passport, the request for change of name or change of name of parent(s), may be accepted in case the changed name and the adoptive parent(s) name are already recorded in the adoption order issued by the court and as mentioned in the NOC issued by CARA. (ii) In-Country adoption: In case of in-country adoption which does not require a court order, the applicant must follow the name change procedure in para 3.1 for complete change of name. In case in-country adoption has been secured through a court order or through CARA, then the name recorded in the adoption decree or Conformity/No Objection Certificate issued by CARA would be sufficient for change of name. 3.4.2. WHEN AN ADOPTED CHILD DOES NOT HOLD A PASSPORT 3.4.2.1. In the case of an adopted child (in-country/inter-country) who applies for fresh passport, the application may be processed in the normal course as per the name of the child and the adoptive parents recorded in court adoption order. In case a further name change is sought, complete change of name procedure as prescribed at para 3.1 has to be followed. In case of in-country adoption not requiring a court order where the application is for fresh passport, PIA has to ensure that the adoption deed is valid and in case of any doubt, may insist on name change procedure as in para 3.1 where name of the child in the application is different from that in his BC",

It may be noted that a person can change his/her name irrespective of adoption. The requests for such change in name of the child should be dealt with in accordance with the instructions regarding change in name in Para 3.1., irrespective of the fact whether it is asked for due to adoption. 3.5. Change of name by Minors 3.5.1. In case of minors, the requests for change in name should be entertained only from their biological parents or legally adoptive parents (and not from their guardians unless such guardian has been appointed by court order). Name change procedure, except for cases under para 3.2 for correction in name, will apply in re-issue cases. 3.6. Repeated name change 3.6.1. Only one name change as per existing procedure should be allowed. For subsequent complete name change (except adding husband\u2019s surname by women and adding father\u2019s surname), an applicant should submit two documentary proofs that he/she had indeed changed the name in his/her other documents as well to conform to the name change already effected previously in passport. Otherwise, the applicant would be holding multiple identities. Applications for repeated name change without such documentary proof should not be accepted [Ministry\u2019s Circular No. VI/401/01/05/2008 dated 14/09/2009]. 3.7. In case of government servants or retired government servants, application for change of name may be accepted in lieu of paper clippings with the original or attested copy of official gazette through which the government servant had notified change of his/her name for the purpose of service record, along with copy of duly attested departmental id card/pensioner\u2019s card. 4. CHANGE IN THE NAME OF PARENT(S) 4.1. Request for change in name of parents should normally not be entertained. However, the following cases could be considered: (a) The parents themselves change the name (e.g., parent of a person after following the prescribed procedure, changes his/her name). Now the child of that parent is seeking change of name of the parents in his passport. (b) There was some clerical error in respect of the name of the parents and an applicant provides documentary proof showing the correct name (spelling) of his parent(s). (c) In adoption cases [see Chapter 9. Adopted Children (change in name and change of name of parents)]. (d) In case of minors where passport is desired with the name of the step- parent instead of the biological parent. 4.2. Change in the name of deceased parents 4.2.1.

Name change in Goa from Portuguese to English and vice versa 4.3.1. In Goa, the names of a large number of persons were originally recorded in Portuguese; some converted these names into English. Thereafter, some persons wanted these names to be re-converted into Portuguese for the purpose of their migration to Portugal. References are received from PO, Panaji, for correction/change in names or change in the name of parent(s). The passport may be issued with changed name in the following cases, subject to the applicant completing documentation regarding name change: a) Minor correction in name (e.g., D\u2019souza to De Souza, etc.) b) Change of name of parent(s) strictly on the basis of documentary proof such as passport, property titles, etc., that the parent(s) were using in Portuguese sounding names. c) For change in name of the applicant, the procedure laid down in Para 3.1. would apply and pre-police verification is required. 4.4. Inclusion of name of step-parent(s) 4.4.1. Names of both the biological parents must be provided in case of children born out of wedlock. 4.4.2. If an applicant whose biological parents have been divorced and the biological mother/father having the custody of the child gets remarried, applies for passport and wants to get the same issued with the name of the stepfather/step mother instead of biological father/mother, as the case may be, the request of such an applicant parent (in case the applicant is minor)/applicant for the issue of passport with the name of step parent shall be accepted by the Passport Issuing Authority, subject to the submission of the following documents; (a) A self-declaration on a plain paper stating that he/she does not want to have biological father/mother\u2019s name on his/her passport and instead of that, the name of the step father/mother be mentioned against the column of father\u2019s/mother\u2019s name. The applicant also has to declare that in future if there is a litigation, the entire onus to defend such a case will be on him/her and the Passport",

It needs to be noted that an applicant can submit self-attested photocopy of any one of the following documents as proof of date of birth while applying for a new passport: i.

An applicant for a passport has to submit any one of the documents as mentioned in 5.1. above as proof of DOB while submitting the passport application. The DOB mentioned in the document would be recorded in the passport. In case there is a discrepancy between the DOB previously recorded in the passport and the new proof of DOB submitted by the applicant at the time of reissue of passport, the Passport Issuing Authorities (PIA) are authorized to consider the explanation of each applicant seeking change in the DOB. 5.3. Accordingly, the following revised procedure shall be adopted by all PIAs in India and abroad for change of DOB/place in passports: 5.3.1.

Accordingly, the following revised procedure shall be adopted by all PIAs in India and abroad for change of DOB/place in passports: 5.3.1. Where an applicant claims clerical/technical mistake in the entry relating to birth/place of birth in the passport and seeks rectification, in all such cases, the documents produced earlier as proof of DOB at the time of issue of passport may be perused (if not already destroyed) by the issuing PIA. In case, it is a mistake either by the applicant or a clerical mistake by the issuing PIA, date/place of birth correction may be allowed by issue of fresh booklet without any limitation of time. In case of mistake by the applicant, fee for fresh passport to be charged and in case of mistake by the PIA staff, fresh passport to be issued on \u2018gratis\u2019 basis [as mentioned in Ministry\u2019s circular No. VI/401/2/5/2001 dated 29/10/2007]. 5.3.2. If an applicant applies for correction of date of birth in the passport on the basis of a fresh or corrected Birth Certificate (the original BC was submitted earlier for issue of the first passport), the following procedure be followed: a) In case of furnishing of a new amended BC with the same date of issue and registration number of the old BC by the same authority, application for change in DOB be processed subject to physical verification of the new BC; b) In case of furnishing of a new BC by a different authority in replacement of old BC by another authority, the PIA shall insist on cancellation of the old BC and after physical verification of the cancellation certificate and the fresh BC from issuing authorities, application for change in DOB be processed; c) In case of furnishing of a new BC where the first passport was obtained using other documents like educational school certificates etc., application for change in DOB be processed subject to physical verification of the new BC and other supplementary documents (if required); 5.4. In case of DOB change applications based on fraudulent documents or /and suppression of material information or/and furnishing of wrong information, the Passport Authorities shall take appropriate steps for imposition of monetary penalty OR filing of criminal case against the offender applicant, as the case may be, in terms of the statutory provision of Section 12 of the Passports Act, 1967. 5.5. Change of DOB in respect of Government Servants: Apart from documentary proof as for normal applicants, Government servants should show proof that the change in DOB has been effected in their service records. 6. CHANGE OF PLACE OF BIRTH 6.1. The Birth Certificate is the only document which besides the DOB also contains the entry of POB of the applicant. Hence, the same can be accepted as the sole and the most reliable document to confirm the POB of an applicant applying for the re-issue of a passport with changed POB.

In case, the previous passport had been obtained on the basis of the Birth Certificate issued by a certain agency and now the applicant along with a new Birth Certificate issued by the same or different agency applies for reissue of passport with the changed POB, the request for the change of POB would not be accepted by the Passport Issuing Authority unless the previous Birth Certificate is cancelled by the respective agency and the new Birth Certificate is verified by the issuing agency. This would further be subject to imposition of pecuniary penalty and other usual checks prescribed in the Passport Act, 1967 and the Passport Manual. 6.2. PIAs shall not insist on declaratory court orders for change of place of birth by applicants. Such applications shall first be examined by the PIAs on the basis of procedure stipulated above. In case of rejection of such applications by the PIAs, the applicants are free to seek legal remedy. 6.3. Since applicants randomly write village or town or city as POB, it is possible that a person born in a suburb may write the name of the main city itself. Accordingly, PIAs shall not reject such applications and also not contest court cases on change of POB if the place already recorded in the passport and the one the applicants wants to change fall within the same district or adjoining districts. However, when such change is apparently fraudulent and sought to be made from one state to another (except in neighbouring/ bifurcated/ reorganized States etc); the case should be examined thoroughly and properly contested in the court (if the litigation in this regard has already been initiated by the applicant) under intimation to the Ministry. 6.4. In case of applications for change of POB from India to abroad, or from abroad to India, it involves the question of Indian citizenship and fraudulent obtaining of Indian passport. If POB is claimed to be outside India, PIA should confirm (i) if birth registration has been done at the Indian Mission/Post; (ii) if first passport was not issued from abroad, then whether the applicant travelled on the mother\u2019s passport; (iii) whether foreign birth certificate is genuine; and (iv) why previous passport (s) was obtained with a wrong POB. In order to obtain immigration quotas based on place of birth or to obtain foreign passports, applicants often try to get their POB changed from India to abroad. 7. CHANGE OF SEX 7.1. There are rare cases of request for change in sex consequent to medical procedure changing sex of an individual. The applicant should give a sworn affidavit regarding the change in sex and furnish supporting certificate from the hospital where he/she underwent the medical treatment for the purpose. Since",

The applicant should give a sworn affidavit regarding the change in sex and furnish supporting certificate from the hospital where he/she underwent the medical treatment for the purpose. Since the change in sex will also normally require a change in name, the applicant in that eventuality, will also have to follow the procedure in para 3.2 above regarding change of name. Passport should be issued on such application only after fresh police verification. Change in sex from male/female to Transgender does not require submission of any surgical reconstruction certificate. If an applicant\u2019s claims his sex as transgender, the applicant\u2019s claim may be accepted in good faith as it is a matter of self-identity. 8. CHANGE IN APPEARANCE 8.1. Passport can be reissued for change in appearance, subject to post-Police Verification in case of minor change and pre-Police Verification in case of substantial change of appearance . This will also apply to Sikh applicants who want to change from turbaned image to clean shaven image or vice versa. 9. CHANGE OF ADDRESS 9.1. Any of the following documents may be accepted as Proof of Residence at the time of applying for a new passport i. Aadhaar Card/ e-Aadhar/ Letter containing the unique Aadhar number ii.

CHANGE IN SIGNATURE 10.1. The passport can be reissued in such cases after following application processing formalities. 11. POLICE VERIFICATION 11.1. Pre-Police Verification will be required in case of change in name or other particulars. **** 4. ISSUE OF PASSPORTS TO MINORS 1. SEPARATE PASSPORTS TO MINORS 1.1. The names of children are not to be included in the passports of the parents. All minor children are required to have separate passports with effect from April 1997. A minor child below 15 years of age is issued a passport with five years validity or till the minor attains the age of 18 years. The validity of five years is because the physical appearance of the child changes considerably over five years. 2. PROCEDURE 2.1. The procedure is almost the same as for issue of ordinary passport. In case of minors, the passport application form and other documents, if any, have to be signed by the parents or the legal guardian/local guardian, as the case may be. Either the parents or the legal guardian/local guardian shall be present at the PSK/ POPSK while applying for a passport for their minor child/ children or one parent with passports of both the parents may be present. However, additional documentation is required as given in Para 3 below. 3. CONDITIONS AND REQUIREMENTS FOR ISSUE OF PASSPORT TO MINORS 3.1. All applications of issue or re-issue of passport to minors shall be processed on pre-PV basis unless submitted under Tatkaal scheme when the same may be processed on post-PV basis. Passport may be issued on no-PV basis only in respect of adopted minor children in cases of inter-country adoption when necessary NOC and Conformity Certificate are also submitted. 3.2. Children between the ages of 15 and 18 have the option to apply for a minor passport valid until he/she attains 18 years of age or full validity passport on \u2018pre- PV\u2019 basis. If the previous passport had been issued from India, then clearance may be obtained from the previous PIA. 3.3 The following documents should be submitted along with the application: a) Documentary proof of residence of either parent if the address is different",

Separate Passports to Minors 2. Procedure 3. Conditions & Requirements for Minor Passport 4. Special cases of Minors requiring Passports 5. Children born abroad & holding foreign passport b) Both the parents should sign Annexure \u2018D\u2019 of Appendix-1 in fresh or reissue cases. [Both parents shall be present at the PSK while applying for passport for their minor children or one parent with passports of both the parents may be present. In case either parent is resident abroad, the consent of that parent in Annexure \u2018D\u2019 duly attested by the Indian Mission/Post abroad should be submitted. The parent who is submitting the application in India will sign the application form and will attach Annexure-\u2018D\u2019 duly attested by the Indian Mission/ Post abroad.] c) If Annexure-\u2018D\u2019 is not signed by both the parents, a single parent must submit a declaration in the form in Annexure-'C' stating the reasons except in cases where the single parent has got full custody of the child without visitation rights for the spouse. In case divorce proceedings are pending, court permission is required for issue of passport to a minor child. In case of seaman/sailors who are on board ships and not able to visit Indian Missions/Posts abroad, the requirement for signing Annexure \u2018D\u2019 shall be waived on furnishing proof of their employment. d) In case both the parents are living abroad, the parents need to appoint a local guardian who can complete and submit the passport application. The parents need to furnish a joint sworn affidavit (both parents need to sign) duly attested by the Indian Mission/Post abroad. The passport will be issued subject to pre-PVR. The prescribed affidavit from two responsible persons, who both know the local guardian and the minor, should be submitted with the application. However, if the local guardian is one of the grandparents of the minor, the affidavit from two responsible persons is not required. e) Legal guardian can also apply for the passport of a minor child. He/ She needs to submit, besides standard documents, a certified copy of the court order appointing him/her as legal guardian. 3.4 In case both the parents have expired and the application is filed by the grand parents or other surviving relatives, the normal procedure shall apply. In cases of legal or local guardian also, pre-PV is mandatory. 4. SPECIAL CASES OF MINORS REQUIRING PASSPORTS Exclusion of father/mother name from passport of minor in single parent custody 4.1.

The online passport application form now permits that an applicant may provide the name of father or mother or legal guardian, i.e., only one parent and not both. This would enable single parents to apply for passports for their children and get passport(s) issued where the name of either the father or the mother is not required to be printed at the request of the applicant. 4.2. In case of minor children of unwed single parent, the name of father or mother is not to be mentioned in the passport application and in the passport. In case of unwed parents submitting Appendix-12, name of both the parents is to be mentioned in the application form and in the passport. 4.3. In case of minor children of married parents, the name of father/mother shall be furnished by the other single parent having the custody of the child, irrespective of the status of their marriage, such as, divorced, divorce pending, separated or deserted, with or without visitation rights to the estranged parent. Children of divorced parents 4.4. Application from divorced parents for issue of passports to their minor children has to be processed with care and diligence. Whereas the divorce of parents does not result in severance of the relation between the child and the parent, unless the parent has legally disowned the child, the child\u2019s right to have a passport and travel abroad cannot be denied on such grounds. Children also have a fundamental right to travel and the other parent cannot wilfully prevent them from travelling abroad. These realities have been taken into account while processing applications for passports from children in the custody of single parents. 4.5. A court decree granting divorce would normally award custody of the minor child/children to either parent. The PIA must ensure that the application for the minor\u2019s passport is entertained only from such parent who has been granted custody by the court. While doing so, the PIA must also satisfy himself that the period of limitation for appeal against such decree has expired before issuing the passport. PIA must also ensure that if the other parent has visitation or other rights on the child as per court order, the consent of the other parent is also furnished. However, in rare cases where one of the parents wilfully refuses to give consent or inordinately delays consent or objects in writing to the PIA against issue of passports to his/her children residing with other parent without any cogent reason, and thus denying the fundamental right of the children to travel, passports may be issued to the child/children, after receipt of an affidavit in the form of Annexure \u2018C\u2019 obtained from the parent having the custody of the children, stating that the other parent is wilfully denying or not granting permission for issue of passports to the children.

The other parent should be informed in writing in advance by the PIA of the proposed issue of passport to children at the request of the parent who is having the custody of the children. It will then be the responsibility of the other parent to approach the courts for suitable redressal. Divorce pending cases 4.6. In case divorce is still pending before the Court, the PIA shall insist on consent of both the parents. Alternatively, the applicant\u2019s parent should furnish or obtain permission from the court to apply for a passport for the child without the consent of the other parent of the child. In pending divorce cases, where the single parent with child is already working/ staying abroad, the child requires a passport for its continued stay abroad. In such a situation, the Mission/Post abroad may issue a two-year short validity passport to the child, at a time, pending court permission for issue of a regular passport or direction for custody of the child. Single divorced parent with exclusive custody of child without visitation rights for the other parent 4.7. Where the custody of the child has been given exclusively to either parent without any visitation rights to the other parent, the question of obtaining consent of the other parent would normally not arise. A certified copy of the court order has to be submitted with the application and Annexure \u2018C\u2019 signed by the single parent. Single separated parent 4.8. In case one married parent has terminated the relationship with the other parent without a formal divorce, an declaration in the format of Annexure \u2018C\u2019 may be accepted from the parent having the custody of the child. Child of unwed mother 4.9. In case of an unwed mother, and where the father of the child is either known or unknown, for example a child born after a rape, etc., the single unwed parent shall furnish a declaration in Annexure \u2018C\u2019 and \u2018D' of Appendix-1. The name of the father should be left blank. Child born outside of wedlock 4.10. In cases where the child is born outside of wedlock (including parents married to different persons), but with both the biological parents accepting parentage of the child, both the names of the biological parents can be entered in the child\u2019s passport, after obtaining a declaration in Annexure-D signed by both the parents. In the declaration, they should confirm their relationship and declare that the child was born out of their relationship but without the formal legal sanction of marriage. It has been confirmed by Legal & Treaties Division of the Ministry of External Affairs that the issue of a passport to the minor with the names of both the biological parents, cannot be treated as legalizing the parent\u2019s relationship for other purposes such",

In cases where: (i) the married parent who is an Indian citizen, claims that the father had no contact with the mother or the child after the birth of the child; or where (ii) the father has terminated the relationship with the mother and the child after conception/birth of the child, a declaration in Annexure \u2018C\u2019 shall be submitted by the parent with the custody of the child. Cases where a biological married/unmarried father who is an Indian citizen seeks passport for his child claiming that the biological mother has abandoned the child, the procedure as applicable for single mother would apply mutatis mutandis. However, the PIA shall exercise caution, inquire and rule out any attempt to permanently spirit away the child from the mother in India or abroad. In many European countries and USA, it is a punishable offence. Note: The Supreme Court, in a judgment dated the 17th February, 1999, while interpreting the scope of the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act, 1956 (32 of 1956), has ruled that when the minor is in the exclusive care and custody of the mother, the mother can act as a natural guardian of the minor and all her actions would be valid even during the life time of the father who would be deemed absent.[Writ Petition(C) No. 489 of 1995 of Ms. Gita Hariharan Versus The Reserve Bank of India]. 4.12. Annexure \u2018C\u2019 and \u2018D\u2019: Their applicability and differentiation: Annexure 'C': This declaration is applicable in cases where for any reason whatsoever the married parent applying for passport for the minor child is not able to obtain the consent of the other parent for obtaining passport for the child. The reasons also include \u2013 wilful denial of consent by the estranged parent; desertion; absence of communication between the divorced/not divorced but separated parents, ex-parte divorce proceedings etc., but exclude cases where both the parents are involved in divorce proceedings in which case, the permission of the court or consent of both the parents in Annex \u2018D\u2019 is required. Annexure 'D': This is for all normal cases where both the parents have to sign Annexure 'D'. Both parents or either parent with passports of both the parents shall be present at the time of issue of fresh passport or reissue of passport to the minor children or one parent with the passports of both the parents. This Annexure is also applicable to a single parent who has got full custody of the child and without any visitation rights to other parent (judgement to be verified); seaman/sailor spouse who are unable to sign Annexure D; unmarried parents submitting an affidavit",

Clarification has been received from MHA that the parents of a child who is born outside India and is eligible for Indian citizenship under Section 4(1) of the Citizenship Act, 1955, have to get the birth of the child registered in the Indian consulate under provisions of Section 4 of the Citizenship Act, 1955. After registration, such child becomes a citizen of India by descent. 5.2. The Mission shall insist on registration of birth of the children born abroad under Section 4(1) of the Citizenship Act, 1955 on the relevant MHA website. The birth of the baby shall also be registered by the Indian Mission/Post abroad within one year. Heads of Indian Missions/Posts abroad have also been delegated powers by MHA to register birth of children even after one year of its occurrence under Section 4 of the Citizenship Act, 1955 vide MHA order No. 26030/129/2015-IC-II dated 15/06/2015. 5.3. Section 4 of the Indian Citizenship Act, 1955 stipulates that no such birth of a child shall be registered unless the Indian parents of such child declare, in such form and in such manner as may be prescribed, that the minor does not hold the passport of another country. An Indian passport can only be issued once the registration of the child as an Indian citizen has been completed. MHA has clarified that a declaration in this regard from the parent is sufficient and that if the minor has obtained passport of any other country (be it his birth country or the country of his non-Indian parent), it should be surrendered before registering the birth of child under section 4(1). 5.4. Section 4(1A) of the Indian Citizenship Act, 1955 states that a minor who is a citizen of India by virtue of this section and is also a citizen of any other country shall cease to be a citizen of India if he does not renounce the citizenship or nationality of another country within six months of attaining full age. However, this does not confer any right for holding an Indian passport simultaneously with a foreign passport. 5.5. In many cases, a child born to Indian parents outside India also becomes eligible for citizenship of another country by virtue of citizenship laws of the country. However, Indian constitution and the Citizenship Act, 1955 do not permit dual citizenship. In view of this, the policy makers had incorporated a provision under section 4(1) of the Citizenship Act, 1955 which requires that at the time of registration of birth, parents have to submit a declaration that the child does not hold the passport of any other country. Furthermore, a minor who is a citizen of India by virtue of section 4 of the Citizenship Act, 1955 and is also a citizen of any other country shall cease to be a citizen of India if he does not renounce the citizenship or nationality of another country within six",

In some countries like Mexico, Mexican citizenship is mandatory for the Indian children born there and they are required to obtain and possess Mexican passports. In such cases, the parents of children born abroad should be advised to first register the birth of their children with the Indian Mission/Post and only afterwards complete the local mandatory procedure for foreign citizenship. The mandatory declaration by the Indian parents that their child does not hold any foreign passport shall be accepted by the Missions/Posts in good faith. In any case, in all such countries where foreign citizenship is granted by birth, the Missions/Posts abroad may insist on renunciation of foreign citizenship and surrender of foreign passport, if any, before extending any passport service to Indian citizens with dual citizenship when they reach the age of 18 years and are eligible to resume Indian citizenship. In case the child has to compulsorily have a foreign passport, the registration process may be completed before acquiring a foreign passport and then the child may apply for an OCI Card. 5.7. As dual citizenship is not permitted as per the Constitution of India, it is clarified that under no circumstances an Indian citizen, including a minor, can possess an Indian and a foreign passport at the same time. ***** 5. ISSUE OF PASSPORTS TO ADOPTED CHILDREN 1. INTRODUCTION 1.1. Issue of passports to \u2018adopted\u2019 children entails additional documentation and is different from issue of passports to minors. Before issue of passports to adopted children, it is the primary duty of the Passport Issuing Authorities (PIA) to ensure that in addition to the normal passport requirements, the applicant is having legally valid adoption papers/ orders and other related documents. 1.2. \u201cAdoption\u201d means the process through which the adopted child is permanently separated from his biological parents and becomes the lawful child of his adoptive parents with all the rights, privileges and responsibilities that are attached to a biological child.\u201d According to Section 63 of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, a child in respect of whom an adoption order is issued by the court, shall become the child of the adoptive parents, and the adoptive parents shall become the parents of the child as if the child had been born to the adoptive parents, for all purposes, including intestacy, with effect from the date on which the adoption order takes effect, and on and from such date all the ties of the child in the family of his/her birth shall stand severed and replaced by those created by the adoption order in the adoptive family. Hindus may also adopt under the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956.",

Hindus may also adopt under the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956. 1.3. The Central Adoption Resource Authority (CARA) [www.cara.nic.in] is a statutory body under the administrative control of the Ministry of Women & Child Development, Government of India. CARA has been designated as the central authority in India to deal with adoptions, especially inter-country adoptions in accordance with the provisions of The Hague Convention on Inter-country Adoption, 1993, ratified by Government of India on 6th June, 2003. 2. PASSPORTS TO ADOPTED CHILDREN 2.1. Issue of passport to adopted children falls in two categories viz. (i) in- country adoption and (ii) inter-country adoption. \u201cIn-country adoption\u201d means adoption of a child by a citizen of India residing in India. \u201cInter-country adoption\u201d means adoption of a child from India by a non-resident Indian or by a person of Indian origin or by a foreigner. In both the cases, the PIA should ensure that the adoption process is complete and that the adoption is legally valid, before issue of passport. 1. Introduction 2. Passports to adopted children 3.

All cases of inter-country adoptions with Court order and NOC from CARA are to be processed on \u2018No-PV\u2019 basis. Documents required (i) Conformity Certificate issued by CARA; (ii) No Objection Certificate (NOC) from CARA (if the original NOC of CARA is not available with the applicant due to the reason that it has been submitted in the court, a copy of the same duly certified/ attested by CARA may be accepted by the PIA for the issue of passport); (iii) Court order on adoption or certified copy thereof; and (iv) Any other document, if required, for issue of passports to minor children . 4.

In view of the adoption guidelines regarding alternate rehabilitation of the child, if the Court order produced along with the passport application is more than 6 months old, before issuing the passport, the PIA should confirm from the SARA/ CARA that there are no adverse reports or pending cases for alternate rehabilitation of the child. 5. COMPULSORY INTIMATION BY PASSPORT OFFICES TO THE CONCERNED INDIAN MISSION/ POST ABROAD: Immediately on issue of passport to the inter- country adopted Indian child to the foreign/NRI family, the issuing Passport Office shall intimate personal and passport particulars of the adopted child and adoptive parents to the concerned Indian Mission/Post abroad for monitoring the child as per Guidelines given at para 6 below. 6.

The Indian Missions/ Posts abroad will help CARA in maintaining liaison with the different authorities and agencies operating in the countries of their jurisdiction. The role of the Mission/ Post includes recommendation of Authorised Foreign Adoption Agency [AFAA], attestation of documents including English translation. Whenever a report is received about disruption of adoption of an Indian child by a foreign couple, the Mission/ Post should contact the authorities concerned to ensure that the interest of the child is being looked after. A report in this regard should also be sent to CARA at the earliest. In case the child is required to be returned to India, the Mission should help and facilitate repatriation of the child.

SURROGATE CHILDREN 7.1. As on date no law exists in India on surrogacy and the guidelines issued by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) are the only set of instruments regulating surrogacy in India. The Ministry, in the light of ICMR guidelines on surrogacy, has stipulated that in case of children born to Indian surrogate mothers, the genetic parents are to be treated as the real biological parents of the surrogate child. Moreover, the third-party anonymous egg/sperm donor and the surrogate mother shall relinquish in writing all parental rights concerning the offspring and vice versa. 7.2. In November 2015, Government of India prohibited foreign couples using Indian surrogate mothers to conceive and deliver their children in India. The Bombay High Court then intervened to allow only those cases where the surrogacy medical procedure had already started when the Government announced the ban on foreign biological parents. Subsequently, ICMR vide its circular No. V.25011/119/2015-HR dated 4th November 2015, referring to MHA\u2019s circular No. 25022/74/2011.F.1(Vol.III) dated 03/11/2015 allowed only needy infertile Indian couples to opt for surrogacy of the altruistic kind without involving payment of any charges to the surrogate mother except medical expenses. MHA, vide above circular, has advised all Indian Missions/Posts not to issue visas to foreign couples visiting India for commissioning surrogacy and FRROs were advised not to allow foreigners including OCI card holders from commissioning surrogacy in India. 7.3. As and when an Indian/genetic parent(s) applies for issue of passport for a minor child born through surrogacy, the Passport Authority shall ask the applicant genetic parent(s) to submit/fulfil the following documents/conditions in order to conclusively prove/establish the biological/genetic parentage of the child: a) notarized Surrogacy agreement executed between the parties related to the surrogacy i.e. the genetic parent(s) and the surrogate mother; (Ref: OM No. VI/405/4/3/2017 dated 14th September 2018) b) Bona fide certificate issued by the head of the Fertility Clinic/Centre where the surrogacy was carried out; c) Birth Certificate issued by the competent authority in the",

PASSPORTS TO STUDENTS WHO STAY AWAY FROM THEIR PARENTS 1. SHORT VALIDITY ORDINARY PASSPORT OF FIVE YEARS i) Minor students up to the age of 15 years, and ii) Students between 15-18 years of age when minor passport applied for valid up to the age of 18 years. 1.1. The procedure for minor students staying away from their parents is the same as prescribed in Chapter-9 relating to issue of passports to minors. Such cases obviously fall under any category of minors defined in that chapter. However, students staying away from their parents have the option of applying for passport either at the PO in whose jurisdiction the educational institution/ hostel/ place of stay of the minor student falls or the PO in whose jurisdiction his/ her parents reside. In the former case (place away from parents), a letter from the educational institution/ hostel authorities/ local guardian certifying the student\u2019s study/ stay is required to be furnished in addition to the normal documentation. 1.2. In case the parent submits the application, normal rules for minor will apply. On the other hand, if a local guardian submits the application, parents\u2019 consent and affidavits from two responsible persons who know both the local guardian and the minor should be submitted with the application (Appendix-11). However, if the local guardian is one of the grandparents, the affidavits from two responsible persons are not required. 1.3. With effect from 26 June, 2018, an applicant can apply for passport from anywhere in India. This citizen-friendly initiative will enable applicants to choose the PO and thus the desired Passport Seva Kendra (PSK)/ Post Office Passport Seva Kendra (POPSK) under the PO where they wish to submit their application irrespective of whether the present residential address specified in the application form lies within the jurisdiction of the selected PO or not. Police verification, if applicable, would be conducted by the Police Station in whose jurisdiction the address mentioned in the form falls and the passport will also be printed and dispatched to the same address by the PO. 1.

Police verification, if applicable, would be conducted by the Police Station in whose jurisdiction the address mentioned in the form falls and the passport will also be printed and dispatched at the same address by the PO . 3. DOCUMENTS REQUIRED 3.1. In view of the genuine difficulty being faced by the student passport applicants who are unable to produce the original documents due to these being deposited with the educational institutions, it has been decided to waive the mandatory requirement of producing originals of such documents. In such cases in the absence of original documents, the passport applicants may submit the following documents: (i) A certificate from the recognized educational institution where the passport applicant is studying to the effect that he/she is studying in that institution and the original certificates are retained with that recognized educational institution; (ii) Photocopy of such documents duly attested by the educational institution where the original certificates have been retained; (iii) A copy of valid identity card of the applicant issued by the educational institution where the applicant is studying. In case of any doubt about the genuineness of any certificate submitted by the applicant, the PIA may conduct the verification of genuineness of such certificates from the issuing authorities. The decision of the PIA will be final in such cases. 4. POLICE VERIFICATION 4.1.

PP forms should be obtained in duplicate for verification both at the educational institution/ stay and parents\u2019 present address. A certificate from educational institution with photograph will help police in verification. Field police verification is required from place of stay whereas only police record verification is needed at the parents\u2019 address. A police report stating that the applicant was not physically present at the parents\u2019 address should not be treated as incomplete/adverse. 4.3. There are a number of cases where the applicant left the place of study and the PVR is adverse on account of that. In such cases, PVR in respect of parents\u2019 address shall be relied upon, irrespective of jurisdiction of the PIA. Alternatively, PIAs may close the pending applications/cases enabling the students to reapply from their parents\u2019 address. **** 7. ISSUE OF PASSPORTS UNDER TATKAAL SCHEME 1.

Note: Tatkaal fees may be collected only after an application has been accepted for issue of passport under Tatkaal scheme. 5. ADVERSE PVR DUE TO ABSENCE OF TATKAAL PASSPORT HOLDERS 5.1. In quite a few cases, \u2018Tatkaal\u2019 applicants on receipt of passport on post-PV basis, proceed abroad for employment/studies, leaving the PV process incomplete. Presence of the applicant during PV is now not essential for confirmation of identity including nationality etc. by the police. , it is not possible to exempt such cases from PV and their PVR remains ADVERSE. Missions/Posts may therefore advise such passport holders to return to India and complete PVR procedure. No passport services be given to such persons with Adverse PVRs. The original PIA in India that issued the Tatkaal passport shall facilitate conduct of fresh PV in such cases on application by the Tatkaal passport holder. 6. WALK-IN APPLICANTS Certain categories of applicants such as senior citizens, minors and differently-abled applicants are required to submit their applications online and obtain an Application Registration Number (ARN), and then visit the nearest PSK during prescribed hours for which no prior appointment is required. Applicants should also refer to advisory, if any, issued by the concerned Passport Offices from time to time. Government may also offer such walk-in facility to applicants who are affected due to natural calamity etc. 7.TIME FRAME FOR ISSUE OF PASSPORTS UNDER TATKAAL DURING PV Normally, Tatkaal passport should be issued in 3 working days, excluding date of appointment as listed in the Citizens Charter. This timeframe would apply to both Fresh and Reissue cases. 8. EXCLUDED CATEGORIES 8.1. Tatkaal passport cannot be issued to persons falling in the following categories:- i. Lost/stolen cases (in exceptional cases where PVR is clear, PIAs may accept lost cases); ii. Fresh issue of passports to citizens of India by Registration/Naturalization (granted citizenship by MHA); iii. Applicants repatriated from abroad at Government cost; iv. Applicants deported to India on passport or EC; v. Change in name; vi. Change in sex; vii. Change in appearance; viii. Change/correction of date of birth or place of birth; ix. Change of father/mother/spouse name ; x. Change in signature; xi. Persons of Naga origin including minors (below 18 years); xii. Persons of Naga origin residing outside Nagaland; xiii.

CONVERSION OF TATKAAL APPLICATION INTO NORMAL CATEGORY 10.1. Application submitted under \u2018Tatkaal\u2019 category can be converted to Normal, if the applicant does not furnish the documents specified or the application is not eligible for \u2018Tatkaal\u2019. Since \u2018Tatkaal\u2019 fee is collected at Passport Seva Kendras (PSK) only after verification of eligibility for \u2018Tatkaal\u2019, there is no question of reimbursement of additional \u2018Tatkaal\u2019 fee collected. However, CPO officers in charge of PSK shall ensure that \u2018Tatkaal\u2019 appointment process is not misused by Normal applicants by intentionally applying for \u2018Tatkaal\u2019 without being eligible for this service. 10.2. Normal cases requiring no-PV or post-PV may be converted into \u2018Tatkaal\u2019 by DPO/APO in charge of PSK on payment of additional fees. 10. CLARIFICATIONS 11.1. \u2018Tatkaal\u2019 applications are accepted through online filing system only. An applicant has to first file online application, print out a copy of application so filed, visit the PSK on the date of appointment (automatically generated at the time of online filing) with all original documents & photocopies thereof and complete the application submission formalities. 11.2. Full validity passport is issued against \u2018Tatkaal\u2019 application. 11.3. In Lost/stolen cases, DRILS and Issue of Loss of Passport circular procedure have to be completed. Hence, it is not possible for PSK to accept \u2018Tatkaal\u2019 applications in respect of Lost/Stolen passports. In exceptional cases where PVR is CLEAR with photo, PIAs may accept \u2018Lost\u2019 cases under \u2018Tatkaal\u2019. 11.4. Applications for re-issue of passports in lieu of damaged passport can be considered by the PIA under \u2018Tatkaal\u2019, only in case of first damage or in case of poor quality of passport booklets such as cover/stitching coming off. It is absolutely essential that personal particulars, including photograph, clear PVR are verified in PRIDE or from original records before a passport is re-issued in such cases. However, if the photograph on the damaged passport is beyond clear recognition, such application should not be accepted under \u2018Tatkaal\u2019 except when two or more valid photo identity documents are submitted. In such cases, it should be verified that photo in PRIDE matches with that of applicant. Note: It may be noted that there have been many cases of identity theft in recent years by furnishing tampered photocopies of passports by applicants who report completely damaged passports. 11.5. Passports issued by Missions/Posts abroad are normally re-issue cases. In Missions abroad where passport printing facilities are available, re-issue cases can be considered under \u2018Tatkaal\u2019 scheme, provided the prescribed additional fee is paid in all such out of turn cases. Passports may be renewed by Indian Missions/Posts abroad even in case an \u2018Adverse\u2019 PVR exists in the system on account of the absence of the \u2018Tatkaal\u2019 passport holder during police",

MISCELLANEOUS SERVICES ON PASSPORTS 1. GENERAL 1.1. Passport Authorities are required to perform certain miscellaneous services which flow from the issue of passports. A number of these services are performed to assist our nationals who are required to comply with specific requirements in foreign countries. Most of these services are of notarial nature and are described in detail in the Consular Manual with which Passport Authorities should also familiarize themselves. This chapter is more relevant to Passport Authorities abroad although some services are performed by Passport Authorities in India as well. 1.2. The miscellaneous services on passports are normally rendered on the same day. The procedure regarding grant of miscellaneous services on the passport is similar to the one outlined in previous chapters, except police verification. Each time an application is filed for any passport service, Index, PAC and PRIDE must be checked before granting the service. The service should be granted only if such internal checks do not find anything adverse. It should not be assumed that because a passport has already been granted to the person, there is nothing against the passport holder that may attract the provisions of Sections 10 (3) and/ or 12 of the Passports Act, 1967. 2. POLICE CLEARANCE CERTIFICATE (PCC) A. PCC TO INDIAN PASSPORT HOLDERS 2.1. Police Clearance Certificate is not strictly a passport service. An application for PCC shall be accepted only from applicants holding a valid Indian passport and not with reissue application. PCC/Character Certificate (CC) is required by many foreign Governments for considering applications for resident status, employment or long term visa or for immigration. PIAs may grant Character Certificate or PCC to Indian passport holders, subject to Index /PAC/PRIDE check and fresh CLEAR PVR. 2.2. For all applications for PCC submitted in India and in the Missions/ Posts abroad, a fresh police report should be called for and PCC/CC should be issued only on receipt of a CLEAR police report. Missions/Posts abroad that are integrated to the PSP System may generate police report through DPHq model and 1. General 2. Police Clearance Certificate (PCC) 3. Certificates in lieu of passports under submission 4. Surrender of Indian Passport 5. Renunciation Certificate other Missions/ Posts abroad may adopt the same route of getting a PVR through concerned Passport Office. 2.3. Details regarding issue of PCC to an applicant are available in the PRIDE database and these details are also accessible to all the Passport Issuing Authorities (PIA) in India and abroad. There is no requirement of making manual endorsement regarding issue of PCC in the passport of an applicant and entries to this effect will only be made in the PRIDE database",

There is no requirement of making manual endorsement regarding issue of PCC in the passport of an applicant and entries to this effect will only be made in the PRIDE database so that it could be verified by any PIA online. If an applicant while applying for PCC is providing the details which are different to details available in the passport already held by him/her, instead of processing the PCC application further, the Passport Authority should ask such an applicant to first apply for re-issue of passport with changed/current particulars as provided in PCC application form and a fresh Police Verification report may be generated. Only after re-issue of passport with changed/existing particulars, the PCC application against such reissued passport may be processed further for the issue of PCC. [VI/405/4/13/2016 dated 21st December 2016]. 2.4. The PCC application form has been revised to clearly show the purpose for which PCC is being issued to Indian passport holders. An applicant may apply for PCCs to be submitted to foreign Missions/Governments for purposes of citizenship/immigration, visa, residence/work permit, education/research, etc. The PCC application form has a pull-down Menu from which an applicant has to choose the purpose for which PCC is being sought. The PCC form also requires the applicant to declare the country for which PCC is required. PCC may be issued only for purpose and mentioning the country for which it is sought. 2.5. In the case of issue of PCCs to wards of officials who hold/held Diplomatic/Official Passports and who stay/ stayed with their parents abroad in Missions/Posts abroad, it has been decided by the Ministry that the following procedure shall be followed by PIAs in India and abroad: a) Passport Issuing Authorities (PIAs) are authorised to issue PCC to such applicants if there is no adverse record against them without the need for fresh Police Verification (PV). If application for PCC is submitted at a different Mission/Post/PIA, it may be issued after taking clearance from the concerned Indian Mission/Post where the applicant stayed during the period for which the PCC is required. a) If applied in India in respect of stay abroad, PCC may be issued after obtaining clearance from the Mission/Post abroad where the applicant stayed during the period for which PCC is required. c) PCC on Diplomatic/Official passports may not be issued unless clearance from concerned Administration Section in the Ministry is submitted. B. PCC TO FOREIGNERS 2.6. Foreigners who have previously resided in India may also on occasion apply for Police Clearance Certificate for obtaining visas/residence permit/employment for certain other countries which require such documentation. Indian Missions/Posts abroad can issue such certificates in the prescribed form if such foreigners do not figure in the Black List or warning circulars. 2.7.

It should also be checked that there was \u2018CLEAR\u2019 PV in respect of the last Indian passport held. 2.8. In case there is any adverse information against the applicant, a reference may be made to MHA (Foreigners Division) and PCC may be issued only on receipt of clearance. 2.9. Foreigners resident in India should not apply for PCC to the Passport Authority. The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), vide letter no. 25022/42/2009-F.I dated 12th April 2019 has conveyed that FRROs/FROs may issue Police Clearance Certificate (PCC) to those foreign nationals who are staying in India or have previously resided in India but not registered with FRROs/FROs for the purpose of obtaining visa for certain other countries. PCC in such cases may be issued, after due enquiry and verification of the records of concerned police station, through the existing online mode available on www.indianfrro.gov.in. 2.10. Foreigners who visited India on ITEC/ICCR training/scholarships may be issued PCCs after obtaining confirmation from the DPA-III Division of Ministry of External Affairs and confirmation of due completion of course from the concerned Institute/ICCR. 2.11. Foreign diplomats and children of foreign diplomats, including those who may have been born in India or posted in India may be issued PCC once confirmation of their particulars and tenure is obtained from the concerned Territorial Division of the Ministry of External Affairs. 2.12. The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), vide letter no. 25022/05/2009-F.IV dated 27th March 2019 has conveyed that since Tibetans are treated at par with foreigners, the provisions contained in para 22.16 of the Visa Manual will also apply to Tibetans. Hence, the following instructions may be followed in this regard: (i) In the case of a Tibetan staying abroad seeking a Police Clearance Certificate (PCC) with reference to his/her earlier stay in India, the Indian Mission/Post concerned may issue PCC subject to the condition that the Tibetan concerned does not figure in the negative list or warning circulars and does not have any adverse endorsement about his/her previous stay in India on his/her Certificate of Identity/passport. (ii) In the case of a Tibetan residing in India seeking a Police Clearance Certificate (PCC) with reference to his/her stay in India, the FRRO/FRO concerned may issue PCC subject to usual checks. Such PCC may be issued by FRRO/FRO concerned as per the format enclosed at Annexure-II. C. PCC IN PSK 2.13. PSK will generate PP form and escalate the case to PO, after checking the passport details. PSKs shall not retain the passport, unless required due to impounding/ revocation/detection of double passport/adverse PV etc. When clear PV is received, PO may issue the PCC.

As PCC is mainly a police clearance, registered criminal FIRs would also render an applicant ineligible for PCC unless the police give a CLEAR report. 3. CERTIFICATES IN LIEU OF PASSPORTS UNDER SUBMISSION 3.1. When an Indian citizen applies for duplicate passport (in lieu of lost/damaged passport) or when a passport is under submission to the Mission/ Post or passport is impounded/revoked and the Mission/ Post is in possession of the same, on request, a certificate to that effect that the passport is under submission to the Mission/ Post may be issued. The certificate should invariably contain the date up to which it is valid. If the applicant approaches the Mission again for another certificate on expiry of the validity of the certificate, it should be retained in the custody of the Mission/ Post and a new certificate be issued. Whenever, a passport is re-issued, the certificate should be retrieved and cancelled. 4. INDIAN PASSPORT SURRENDER CERTIFICATE 4.1. Indian nationals are required to surrender their passports on acquisition of foreign nationality. Such passports when surrendered should be cancelled and returned to the passport holder, along with the Surrender Certificate. It should be ensured that DRILS entry with remarks \u201cAcquired..... (name of the country) citizenship\u201d be made in the PRIDE database. For more details on Surrender Certificate and Renunciation Declaration, Chapter 29 on \u2018Citizenship related Issues\u2019 may be referred to. 5. RENUNCIATION OF INDIAN CITIZENSHIP AND RENUNCIATION CERTIFICATE 5.1. Indian nationals are not permitted to hold dual citizenship as per law. On acquiring foreign citizenship/foreign passport, an Indian citizen is expected to renounce his Indian citizenship as per Section 8(1) of the Citizenship Act, 1955 and a Renunciation Certificate, as in Appendix-17 may be issued to him for applying for an Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) Card. A fee of Rs. 5,000 in India and Rs. 7,000 abroad is fixed for issue of Renunciation Certificate. For more details related to renunciation of Indian citizenship, MHA which is the nodal Ministry, may be referred to. ***** CHAPTER - 9 PASSPORTS FOR NAMED FOREIGN COUNTRY 1. INTRODUCTION 1.1. Prior to 1978, India had issued passports and travel documents such as India-Pakistan Passport, Certificate of Travel between India and Bangladesh, India- Sri Lanka Passport and India-Sri Lanka Passport (for Repatriates). However, none of these documents had legal basis under the Passports Act of 1967. This lacuna was removed through the Passports (Amendment) Act, 1978 which amended Section 5 of the original Act and introduced the concept of \u2018Named Foreign Country\u2018 for issuing a passport for certain specific countries. Under Rule 7 of the Passports Rules, two countries were named for the purpose of the extension of",

Since, ICAO has issued guidelines phasing out handwritten passports with effect from 1st April 2010 and phasing out the existing ones with effect from 24th November 2015, \u2018India-Bangladesh\u2019 and \u2018India-Sri Lanka\u2019 passports are no longer being issued. The earlier provisions relating to the issue of such passports are described in the succeeding paragraphs. 2. INDIA-BANGLADESH PASSPORT 2.1. India-Bangladesh Passport was introduced vide Gazette notification 397(E) dated 30th August, I972. The Central Government delegated authority to issue this passport to various State Governments bordering Bangladesh and District authorities in some of these states [GSR 767(E) dated 9th November 1984]. 2.2. India-Bangladesh Passports were valid for a period of three years under the Passports Rules. Format of the passport booklet is at Schedule III, Part III of the Passports Rules. Issue of India-Bangladesh passport was discontinued with effect from 15/11/2013 and the existing passports would remain valid till their expiry. However, Ministry of External Affairs permitted issue of short validity Travel Certificates to officials of Indian states and to the Indian citizens in the erstwhile Indian enclaves in Bangladesh, at the time of exchange of enclaves by the two countries in 2015. 3. INDIA-SRI LANKA PASSPORTS 1. Introduction 2. India-Bangladesh Passport 3. India-Sri Lanka Passport 4. India-Sri Lanka Passport for Repatriates 3.1. Unlike India-Bangladesh passports, India-Sri Lanka passports were in vogue much before the promulgation of the Passports Act, 1967. These passports were earlier being issued by the Mission in Colombo and the Post in Kandy and are no longer being issued. 3.2. Most Indian origin stateless persons living in Sri Lanka have been conferred with Sri Lankan citizenship by an Act in 2003. The Indian Mission/Posts in Sri Lanka are now issuing ordinary MRP passports to the remaining Indian origin persons in lieu of India-Sri Lanka passport. The specimen application form is at Schedule III Part I of the Passports Rules, 1980. 4. INDIA-SRI LANKA PASSPORTS FOR REPATRIATES 4.1. In terms of Schedule II, Part I of the Passports Rules, 1980, this passport was being issued only to those persons who were granted Indian Citizenship under India-Sri Lanka Repatriation Agreements of 1964 and 1974. This passport was issued by the Mission/ Posts in Sri Lanka on gratis basis. The issuance of this passport in India was terminated in June 1991 [Ref. Ministry\u2019s circular No. VI/125/25/90 dated 06/06/1991]. ***** CHAPTER \u2013 10 PASSPORTS FOR HAJ PILGRIMAGE 1. Introduction 1.1.

Ministry\u2019s circular No. VI/125/25/90 dated 06/06/1991]. ***** CHAPTER \u2013 10 PASSPORTS FOR HAJ PILGRIMAGE 1. Introduction 1.1. Consequent upon the decision taken by the Saudi Arabian authorities that the foreign pilgrims must possess international passports, the Government of India introduced a special scheme for issue of separate Haj passports to Indian Haj pilgrims in the year 2009 [Ref. Gazette Notification No. GSR-39O(E) dated 04/06/2009]. Issue of separate Haj passports has since been discontinued. 2. Issue Of Ordinary Passport On Priority To Haj Applicants 2.1. Since 2012, MEA/Haj Committee of India made it compulsory for aspiring Haj pilgrims to possess international passport with at least one year validity to be eligible for applying for selection of Haj pilgrimage. Prior to the beginning of the Haj season, the Haj Committee of India makes available the Haj application forms and also announces the last date for submission of applications with valid Indian passports. All Haj applicants must have MRP passports. 3. Facilitation For Haj Pilgrims 3.1. To avoid last minute rush for passports by Haj applicants, all concerned Passport Offices shall run a campaign December/ January every year in coordination with the respective State Haj Committee and the Haj Committee of India advising intending Haj pilgrims to apply for passport well in time. The Ministry also regularly issues directions to all the Passport Offices (PO) to accord high priority in the processing of passport applications of prospective Haj pilgrims and to ensure timely issuance of passports in such cases upon completion of requisite documentation, police verification and other formalities. Aspiring Haj pilgrims can, therefore, apply for ordinary passports under the normal course throughout the year without the earlier practice of furnishing of Haj cover number or letter from Haj Committee. 4. Opening of Special Counters 4.1. PO who might face a rush of applications from aspiring Haj pilgrims, should open special counters for acceptance of applications, in liaison with the State Haj Committee, whose authorized volunteers can render assistance in such counters. 1. Introduction of Haj Passport 2. Normal Passport on Priority to Haj Applicants 3. Facilitation for Haj Pilgrims 4. Opening of Special Counters 5. Appointment of Nodal Officers 6. Reservation of appointments for intending Haj pilgrims 5. Appointment of Nodal Officers 5.1. PO may, at their discretion, nominate nodal officers every year during the rush period to ensure that passports to Haj pilgrims are issued well before the deadline. 6. Reservation of appointments for intending Haj pilgrims 6.1. For intending Haj pilgrims, PO shall endeavour to arrange walk-in appointments in case of limited numbers. In case of large numbers, adequate number of appointment slots should be reserved for such applicants. **** APPENDIX-1 ANNEXURE \u2018A\u2019 ALL CENTRAL GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES, STATE GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES, EMPLOYEES OF STATUTORY BODIES AND PUBLIC SECTOR UNDERTAKINGS, THEIR SPOUSE AND CHILDREN UPTO THE AGE OF 18 YEARS ARE REQUIRED TO PRODUCE AN IDENTITY CERTIFICATE (STRIKE OUT",

In this regard, DARPG has introduced several measures for strengthening CPGRAMS, viz. Monitoring dashboards for stakeholders facilitate deeper analysis of grievances, capacity building of stakeholders under the Sevottam Scheme for effective redressal of grievances, universalization of CPGRAMS ver 7.0 for auto-routing of grievances to last mile, integration of State portals with CPGRAMS, operationalization of feedback call centers, developing an inclusive system by using common service centers, an effective regional language interface into all Languages listed in the Bth Schedule of the Constitution, and introduction of a Grievance Redressal Index for ranking Ministries/ Departments. 2. To achieve the obiectives of the CPGRAMS, and to satisfactorily resolve the grievances of the citizens, the Ministries/Departments need to review, streamline and strengthen their internal resolution mechanisms. To make the system effective, the following decisions have been taken: A. Grievance Redressal Timelines: - ti) The grievances received on CPGRAMS shall be resolved promptly as soon as they are received but within a maximum period of 3O days. In case redressal is not possible within the prescribed time- frame due to the circumstances such as sub-iudice matters/policy issues etc., an interim/appropriate reply shall be given to the citizen. (ii) The grievances of urgent nature have been mapped on the CPGRAMS with system specifications and flagged to all the Nodal Officers/ Grievance Resolution Officers on the CPGRAMS platform. It shall be incumbent on Grievance Resolution Officers to address urgent grievances on priority basis. B. Closure of Grievances: - i. The disposed grievance will be treated as closed unless the citizen has filed the appeal. lf the appeal is received from the citizenagainst the disposed grievance, the grievance will be treated as closed only after disposal of appeal. ii. After closure of a grievance, citizens have the option to submit their feedback and file appeal. To obtain the feedback on the quality of grievance disposed, an outbound Call Centre has been started' Al[ the citizens, wilt be contacted by the Call Centre to obtain feedback. Citizens will be provided the option to file appeal if they are not satisfied with the grievance disposed. iii. The feedback received from Citizens by the Feedback Call Centre will be shared with Ministries/Departments who would be responsible to devise internal mechanism to deal with the feedback thus received and to make systemic improvements.

The undersigned is directed to say that in line with the directions of the Hon\u2019ble PM during his interaction with the Secretaries to the GOI on 29 th June 2024, DARPG has undertaken a review of existing processes to make CPGRAMS more sensitive, accessible and meaningful to the citizen. In the past, DARPG had introduced several measures for strengthening CPGRAMS and also issued a comprehensive guideline to strengthening Grievance Redressal Mechanism vide this Department OM of even no. dated 27.07.2022, which stand revised/reiterated as under: 1. An integrated user-friendly grievance filing platform CPGRAMS is a common open platform for registration of complains by the citizens on any issue against any public authority in Central Government or States/ UT. It provides role-based access to all Central Ministries/ Departments as well as States / UTs. In addition to CPGRAMS, Ministries/ Departments are also having their own public grievance platforms for services rendered by them. Most of the States too have their own portals for Public Grievances. Integration of all these platforms is important to provide citizen a single window experience and wider accessibility to various PG platforms. This will help deduplication and save time and efforts of officials from resolving same grievances on multiple portals. Hence integration of all PG portals of Central Government offices and State/ UTs through API shall be a priority to optimize operational efficiency of all PG portals. 2. Appointment of Nodal Officer for Public Grievances Nodal Officer for Public Grievances plays a pivotal role in ensuring that grievances from citizens are addressed promptly, fairly, and efficiently. While appointing the Nodal officer for PG, the Ministries shall ensure that the nodal officer shall have enough experience, competency and authority to deal with the public complaints. He shall have the knowledge about the work flow and mapping of officers in each and every vertical in the Ministry/Department including attached/subordinate/autonomous bodies. In the Ministries/Departments where large number of Public Grievances are received, it is advised to appoint a dedicated Nodal officer with independent charge on sufficient rank so as to ensure timely and qualitative disposal of public grievances. 1 S-15/27/2024-PG division I/2539/2024 3. Role of Nodal Public Grievance officer An indicative list of activities to be performed by the Nodal Officer for PG is given as follows: (i) Effective categorization: Performance of CPGRAMS is based on the effective categorization of complaints and their mapping with right authorities. Hence accurate and updated categorization is critical for grievances reaching the right authority in shortest possible time. Nodal PG officer, under the guidance of Secretary, shall undertake review of categorization once in a six months to ensure their relevance and effectiveness for citizen in filing of grievances. (ii) Appointment of Nodal Technical GRO: Updating of Grievance Redressal Officers (GRO)",

Nodal PG officer, under the guidance of Secretary, shall undertake review of categorization once in a six months to ensure their relevance and effectiveness for citizen in filing of grievances. (ii) Appointment of Nodal Technical GRO: Updating of Grievance Redressal Officers (GRO) on CPGRAMS along with their mobile number, ensuring that correct mapping of GROs with the corresponding categories in CPGRAMS etc. is at the heart of the faster grievance resolution process. It is suggested that Nodal GRO appoint a Nodal Technical GRO under him for enabling this process. Updation of Officers\u2019 information regarding his/her mobile number, transfer, retirement and all other technical information regarding CPGRAMS of the Ministry/Department needs to rest with the Nodal Technical GRO. (iii) Monitoring pendency: It is the responsibility of the Nodal Officer to monitor grievances and check quality of disposal. It is the responsibility of Nodal GROs to ensure that the grievances are handled with sensitivity and communication to citizens are polite and respectful. (iv) Nodal PG officer can view the performance of other GROs in the nodal PG officer\u2019s dashboard in CPGRAMS. He is expected to utilize this facility to review the performance of other GROs in his Ministry. (v) DARPG has created a portal for the feedback collected by BSNL on the grievances disposed by the GROs on CPGRAMS. The portal can be accessed on pgportal.gov.in/ccfeedback/ The Nodal officer is expected to analyze the feedback and work on the areas of poor/low feedback. (vi) Root Cause Analysis of Public Grievances to identify areas of concerns and address them through systemic reforms is one of the main objectives of the Public Grievance System. DARPG has set up Data Strategy Unit and developed analytics dashboards powered with AI for deeper analysis of grievances. The Nodal Officer can use the facility developed by DARPG to analyse the pain-points in their schemes/ programmes and address them on a sustainable basis. (vii) DARPG is publishing monthly reports on CPGRAMS. The Reports contains relative performance of Ministry / Departments including the ranking of Ministries on the parameters of Grievance Redressal and Assessment Index (GRAI). Nodal Officer shall utilize the report for 2 S-15/27/2024-PG division I/2539/2024 improving overall performance and ranking of their Ministries/Departments. (viii) Nodal officer shall take note of the complaints appearing in the newspaper/ social media etc. and take suo moto action on the complaints. (ix) At least one day in a month shall be utilized by Nodal GRO for having meetings with all Grievance Redressal Officers in his Ministry/Department regarding pendency, quality of redressal and complaints being received. 4. Setting up a dedicated Grievance Cell in every Ministry To support the Nodal GRO, a dedicated Grievance Cell shall be set up in every Ministry. The Cell shall be adequately staffed with resources having domain knowledge of schemes/ programmes of the Ministry and also having experience and skill for data analytics and root cause analysis of grievances.

The Grievance Cell will function under the overall supervision of Nodal Grievance Officer. 5. Timelines for resolving the grievances 5.1 The 10 steps reforms initiated in CPGRAMS have significantly brought down the average resolution time. Keeping this in view, the maximum redressal time advised by DARPG, for cases in CPGRAMS is further reduced to 21 days. In such cases, where the redressal requires longer time, an Interim reply may be given stating the reason for the same and expected timeline when the grievance could be resolved. 5.2 There might be certain categories of grievances where resolution of grievance is not possible within the stipulated timelines of 21 days due to procedural intricacies etc. Ministries/Departments may identify such categories and suggest the timelines as a guideline to GROs. DARPG will assist Ministries/Departments in this process through use of an algorithm which will generate the optimal time for resolution of a particular grievance based on past history. 5.3 The grievances of urgent/priority nature have been identified on the existing CPGRAMS system based on individual Ministry level prompts. Nodal GROs may like to validate the tagging of grievances by DARPG and ensure that all GROs prioritize these grievances while undertaking resolution 6. Escalation process: Appointment of Appellate Authorities CPGRAMS though by nature is an appeal portal as most of the grievances filed on CPGRAMS are against the previous disposals on other grievance portals, yet it offers one more opportunity to the citizen to raise appeal against the disposal of grievance on CPGRAMS. The appeals are received through CPGRAMS portal or through feedback call centers. Appeal workflow in CPGRAMS presently requires appointment of an officer of the Additional /Joint Secretary rank as the Nodal Appellate Authority (NAA). Sub Appellate Authorities (SAA) may be appointed by the Ministries/Departments under the NAA to offer localized redressal of appeals against 3 S-15/27/2024-PG division I/2539/2024 GROs. The Appellate Authorities are required to examine the appeal independently and take a view to allow or reject the appeal. The appeal shall be disposed of in a maximum of 30 days. 7. Redressal/ Closure of Grievances 7.1 Grievances shall be redressed under \u2018whole of the Government approach\u201d. This means that in no case grievance shall be closed by stating \u201cDoes not pertain to this Ministry/ Department/ Office\u201d or its equivalent language. Efforts shall be made to transfer the same to the right authority if the subject of the grievance does not pertain to the receiving Ministry. 7.2 It has also been observed that Grievances are sometimes closed by GRO after noting that some document/information is not available. It is to submit that there is an existing mechanism in CPGRAMS to ask additional documentation from the citizen. GROs may seek any additional information/documents through this mechanism. They may also call the citizen and",

It is to submit that there is an existing mechanism in CPGRAMS to ask additional documentation from the citizen. GROs may seek any additional information/documents through this mechanism. They may also call the citizen and get the additional papers, if needed. 7.3 After redressal the grievance GRO shall file a detailed Action Taken Report (ATR). DARPG has redesigned its existing Action Taken Reports (ATR) on CPGRAMS to ensure faster closure of frivolous cases and meaningful reporting in other cases. In such cases identified by the GRO as frivolous, GROs would not require to submit detailed ATR and feedback will be disabled on such grievances. 7.4 It has been observed that in several cases, while closing the grievance GROs do not upload the Relied Upon Document. As such, GROs must ensure to upload any letter/order issued by the Ministries/Department for redressal of grievances. They also must give valid and speaking reason while closing the grievances, in case of non-acceptance of request of the citizen. 7.5 The disposed grievance will be treated as closed unless the citizen has \ufb01led the appeal. If the appeal is received from the citizen against the disposed grievance, the grievance will be treated as closed only after disposal of appeal. 7.6 CPGRAMS has multilingual auto translation facility. This facility shall be utilized and reply to the citizen shall be given in the language grievance was filed. 7.7 GROs are advised to follow the Standard Operating Procedure for handling the grievance on CPGRAMS which is enclosed at Annexure to this Circular. 8. Feedback on disposed grievances 8.1 On resolution of grievance, an SMS/email is sent on the registered mobile number & email address of the citizen. If the citizen is not satisfied with the resolution, they can provide feedback on the portal and raise appeal on the portal itself. DARPG has also set up a call center to survey the citizen response on disposal of grievances. Every disposed of grievances is dialed by the operator and citizen response on the disposal is obtained. 4 S-15/27/2024-PG division I/2539/2024 8.2 Going forward feedback will be integrated with other mechanisms like WhatsApp, chatbot etc so that citizens who are not satisfied with their grievance redressal can file an appeal through any of the above mode of feedback. DARPG has created a separate portal https://pgportal.gov.in/ccfeedback where all feedback with call records are available. Nodal PG Officer has been given login credentials to access this portal. Ministries may use this portal for detailed analysis of citizen feedback on their programme/ policies and devise internal mechanism to deal with the feedback to make systemic improvements. 9. Analysis of grievances to review impact of the schemes/ programmes and scope for improvements 9.1 Public grievances are direct feedback from the citizens on performance of programmes / policies/ service delivery of the Government.

Analysis of grievances provide meaningful insight and indicate the areas that require specific attention. Analysis of grievances is extremely useful for driving efficiency in government programmes and policies. 9.2 DARPG has set up Data Strategy Unit and developed two AI powered analytical tools. These dashboards can be accessed on https://treedashboard.in/ and https://dashboard-pmopg.nic.in/igms2/sign-in. DARPG has already shared login credentials of both the dashboards with the Ministries. The facility of DSU on CPGRAMS may be utilized by the Ministries/ Departments for deeper analysis of their grievances. 10. Benchmarking Performances: Grievance Redressal Assessment Index (GRAI) DARPG has introduced a comprehensive Grievance Redressal Assessment Index (GRAI). The objective of GRAI is to assist the Ministries/Departments to review, analyses and streamline their internal grievance redressal mechanism with SWOT analysis. GRAI is based on 4 dimensions of Efficiency, Feedback, Domain and organizational Commitment. It ranks the Ministries Departments on their relative performance for effective handling grievances. The rankings are published every month in the monthly reports on CPGRAMS. An award policy be also introduced to recognize the best practices in handling Public grievances. 11. Communication and Awareness The link of CPGRAMS shall be prominently displayed at the homepage of every Ministry/ Department. The individual schemes/ programmes of the Ministry shall contain the link of grievance portal/ helpline where citizen can contact in case of a grievance. Other mediums of communication including social media handles of Ministry/ Departments shall also be used to create awareness about the grievance/ complaint filing systems in GOI. Success stories and the best practices of CPGRAMS shall be publicized through PIB Statements and social media handles of the Ministries. 5 S-15/27/2024-PG division I/2539/2024 12. Training and Capacity Building DARPG will organize training for GROs on last Friday of every month. User Manual for GRO interface and Citizen interface are also available for self-learning by GROs. A course module on CPGRAMS is available in iGOT. Ministries shall utilize those training facilities to ensure effective and meaningful handling of public grievance. For training of State GROs, DARPG has collaborated with State ATIs under its SEVOTTAM scheme. It supports ATI for training @ Rs 1500 per GRO / per day 13. Review of PG Cases/ PG Appeals in SOMs To institutionalize the mechanism of grievance resolution, and to ensure quality disposal, the Secretary of the line Ministries/Departments may review disposal process of CPGRAMS in Senior O icers Meetings. Secretary/Addl Secretary/Joint \ufb00 Secretary should also examine disposal of grievances every week and issue necessary direction for improvement in quality of disposal. 14.

GRIEVANCE HANDLING PROCESS IN CPGRAMS- STEP BY STEP GUIDE 1.1 CPGRAMS is a Centralized portal which receives grievances on various issues ranging from service delivery, demand under schemes, queries on programmes, complaints against malpractices, corruption, discrimination, etc. The portal is connected to all the Ministries/Departments of the Government of India and its States through role- based access to the officers in the portal. When a citizen lodges a grievance, it gets redirected to the concerned authorities, ensuring it is resolved within the given time frame. CPGRAMS is also available in mobile application. 1.2 Going forward Complaints/ grievances received through physical mode/ Whatsapp/Chatbot shall also be registered in CPGRAMS. There is a possibility that the same grievances have been received by multiple authorities. Hence to avoid duplicate registrations in CPGRAMS only the authority concerned with the subject and also the grievance is addressed to them shall register the grievance in CPGRAMS. NIC will develop a protocol to assign unique code to such grievances registered by the Ministries/ Call center 1.3 After successful registration of the complaint a unique registration ID is generated through which the citizen can track status of his complaint. On resolution of grievance an SMS/email is sent to the registered mobile number & email address of the citizen. If the citizen is not satisfied with the resolution, he can provide feedback on the portal and raise appeal on the portal itself. In those cases where self -feedback is not available on the portal, DARPG tries to reach out the citizen through feedback call center to know whether their grievance has been actually resolved or not Unsatisfied citizen has the option to reopen / file an appeal through feedback call. The CPGRAMS process can be explained in the following Chart 1.4 Chart for Grievance Flow: 7 S-15/27/2024-PG division I/2539/2024 2. References in CPGRAMS not falling under the category of Grievance: 2.1 CPGRAMS Guidelines provides that the following category of references do not fall under the ambit of Public Grievances as they are covered under separate protocols. Following categories are the illustrative list of such references: a. RTI Matters b. Court related / Sub-judice matters c. Religious Matters d. Grievances of Government employees concerning service matters e. Suggestions d. Anything that",

Anything that impacts upon territorial integrity of the country or friendly relations with other countries. 2.2 In case complaint is received under any such categories, it can be closed by the GRO clarifying the rule position to the citizens. DARPG will enhance capability of system for auto identification of such references. However, till such facility is created GRO can identify and mark the complaint under the above categories. He is not supposed to file ATR on those categories and complaints will not go into feedback loop. 2.3 Sometimes frivolous/Spam / abusive / complaints are also received in CPGRAMS. DARPG has developed AI capability to filter those complains at the initial stage. Those grievances are going into Spam box of GRO. If GRO validates the complaint as frivolous/ SPAM then the complaint will be automatically closed and no action will be required on such complaints. Those complaints will not be sent for feedback 8 S-15/27/2024-PG division I/2539/2024 2.4 CPGRAMS also receives suggestions from the citizens. The subject specific suggestions may be forwarded to the concerned Division of the Ministries and an acknowledgment may be sent to the citizen. A template for such acknowledgement will be built in the PG portal. However generic suggestions with no substance can be simply closed. GRO is not supposed to act on the suggestion. Once GRO identifies a reference as suggestion, it will not require to file an Action Taken Report and will not go into feedback loop. 2.5 CPGRAMS also receives lots of references demanding a benefit under a scheme. Though they are not a grievance as such, however, those demand shall be noted by the concerned divisions. GRO therefore shall forward all such references to the concerned division and bulk close such references with a polite rule position. Such references shall also be identified by the GRO as a new demand under a scheme and excluded from the feedback loop. 3. Handling complaints: Different scenarios for a GRO are explained as under: 3.1 Complaint reaches the concerned GRO: 3.1.1 The Grievances shall ordinarily be resolved within a time frame of 21 days. However, grievances identified as priority by the system or where early action is critical such grievances shall be attended to promptly and resolved maximum within 3 days. 3.1.2 If the grievance will take time to resolve beyond the stipulated 21 days an interim reply shall be given to the citizen through interim Action Taken Report (ATR). After final resolution ATR shall be updated with final response. Interim ATR will not go for feedback till the complaint is finally resolved. 3.1.3 If the grievance lacks necessary critical information without which it cannot be processed, the same can be collected either by calling the complainant on",

Grievances shall not be closed on the ground of incomplete information without making genuine effort to reach the complainant and get the complete information. Seeking information through feedback call center will require to establish a workflow between GRO and call Center in CPGRAMS. Going forward, DARPG will develop such a system for the benefit of the GROs. 3.1.5 If GRO is not able to get the requisite information despite his best efforts then the grievance can be closed. Since the grievances could not be redressed in such cases those grievances shall not be sent for feedback. They shall be treated under a separate category \u201cClosed due to insufficient information\u201d. The feedback call 9 S-15/27/2024-PG division I/2539/2024 Center will inform the citizen that their grievances could not resolved due to lack of information (specify information) and they can file again with complete information. 3.1.6 While resolving the grievances if GRO has observed any policy/ process issue that have resulted in grievance he will bring the same to the notice of the concerned Division in Ministry with a copy to the Nodal PG officer. 3.1.7 If the grievance cannot be resolved the, the response to applicant shall contain a reasoned explanation for the same. Such grievances shall not go for feedback loop. 3.2. Complaint got assigned to wrong GRO: 3.2.1 If the grievance does not pertain to GRO, he shall immediately forward the same to the concerned GRO if he knows the correct mapping. If not than it shall be forwarded to the Nodal PG officer of his Ministries/Department/ who will find out the right authority and forward the complaint to them for action. The complaint/ grievance shall be forwarded to the concerned GRO / Nodal; GRO within 48 hours of receipt of the complaint.
