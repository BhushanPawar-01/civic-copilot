For Tatkaal applications, while booking appointment I am asked to choose appointment quota. What is appointment quota?![](/psp/static/media/DownArrow.d12f2113a54c7cfb4e36d1b1cff423a0.svg)

Two appointment quotas 'Normal' and 'Tatkaal' are available for 'Tatkaal' applications. Tatkaal applicants who are not able to book an early appointment under Tatkaal quota may consider booking appointment under Normal quota also. However, Tatkaal fee will be charged irrespective of the quota under which appointment was booked byTatkaal applicant.

A Tatkaal application is not only to get an early appointment but also for faster processing. For example, a Tatkaal application would be processed under post (police) verification. The print queue is also separate thus ensuring faster print of Tatkaal Passports i.e. a Tatkaal Passport would be dispatched within 1-3 days of applicant visiting PSK as against a Normal application which would take longer.

How will the Tatkaal application be processed?![](/psp/static/media/DownArrow.d12f2113a54c7cfb4e36d1b1cff423a0.svg)

Before an applicant chooses to apply under the Tatkaal Category, it is very important to ensure that all the documents required for Tatkaal passport services are available with the applicant.

Once the application is filled under the Tatkaal category, the requisite fee for Tatkaal services is to be paid and appointmentis taken at a particular PSK.It is important to note that all the documents required for Tatkaal passport services are producedin original at PSK for further processing of the Tatkaal application. **At any stage during processing of the Tatkaal application, if it is found that the required documents are not available, or not in order (not meeting the documentary requirements), the application submitted by applicant will be kept on hold for want of requisite Tatkaal documents. Such applications will not be granted on pre-police verification basis.**

Once the application is kept on hold, the further processing of the application will only be resumed,once the applicant submits the required document /documents at PSK. If an application remains on hold for want of pending documents despite reminder beyond 90 days from the On-Hold date, such application will be closed by following the process of automated application closure. No further queries will be entertained once the application has been closed.
